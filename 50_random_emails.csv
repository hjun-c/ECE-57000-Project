lab 10 step 8.2
I am having trouble with the writeup for task 2. I have collected xy plots for all the diodes but when I produce the voltage and current curves, I use the voltage and calculate the current by dividing the voltage across the resistor by its , I get a graph that  does not resemble an IV curve. Here is an example of what is happening: 
My XY plot for the RED led diode: 
The excel graph it produces when I plot voltage vs current:

I hope you all had a restful  break and had time to relax, eat some great food, and enjoy time with friends and family.  As we come back to class tomorrow, the last three weeks of the semester will go fast, so make sure you are on top of  remaining for all your classes.
This is a reminder that your final quiz in ECE 29401 is tomorrow morning 8:30-9:20 am EST.  You can take it from anywhere you want and do not have to come to the classroom; however, I will be there in WALC for anyone who wishes to take it from there as it will be a quiet .  It will also make it easier for me to help if there are any issues with it.  
Good luck and I will see some of you in the morning.
